# AdBlock_Bool

An activism ad that goes through to a website that maliciously blocks out users who disable their ad blocker. A message to turn your ad blocker on will come up. Once the ad blocker is turned on, the sites "please turn off your ad blocker" message will come up. If the user then turns on their ad blocker (if they don't get too confused) it will go back to this ad, which is embedded on the users computer now until they leave the site. This is done to make website designers focus more on their users, and actually choose non-malicious, non-intrusive ads, or lose all their users.
